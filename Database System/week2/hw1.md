### 1.8
> List four significant differences between a file-processing system and a DBMS.

> - A database management system coordinates both logical and physical access to the data, but a file-processing system only provides physical access.
> - A database management system gives us a hierarchy of data, ensures the data can be used by different programs, but data produced by one program in a file-processing system may not be readable by another program.
> - A database management system is designed to allow flexible access to data, a file-processing system is designed to allow pre-determined access to data.
> - A database management system allows concurrency. But usually, a file-processing system doesn't support this.

### 1.9

> Physical data independence is the ability to modify the physical scheme without making it necessary to rewrite application programs. It provides a higher abstraction of data use.

### 2.1
