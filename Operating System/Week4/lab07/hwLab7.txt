1.
 - Ending edge of `str` has been overridden. ('\0')
 - Ending edge of `ilist` has been overridden( size2*sizeof(int) instead of size2)
 It has not free the memory.
2.
 - If newstr is "1",checkIf1 will just return 1 and not free the memory.
3.
 - In `mergeSingleIfDifferent`:  If strcmp(s1,s2)==0, just let str point to NULL,
 this will make memory leak.
