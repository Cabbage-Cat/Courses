## 2.1
- User ask designers:
> - How many projects have you designed?
> - How long have you been in bussiness?
> - How much will the project cost?
> - What will I change the design?
> - What if I'm not happy with the design?

- Designers ask users:
> - What are the project requirements?
> - What is the timeline, deadline for the project?
> - Who will use this project?
> - What software is similar to your project?
> - How much will u cost for the project?

- Designers ask themselves
> - Can we maintain the project?
> - Is the price reasonable?
> - Does all requirements reflect in the software?
> - Does the project has any bug?
> - What if we lost the project?

- Users ask themselves
> - Is the requirements easy to understand?
> - Whether there is sufficient budget
> - Is there user using the software
> - Do I need to change/add the requirement?

## 2.4

>PSP is intellectually challenging and demands a level of commitment (by practitioners and their managers) that is not always possible to obtain. Training is relatively lengthy, and training costs are high. The required level of measurement is culturally difficult for many software people

## 2.6

>Advances in large-scale, distributed software systems are changing the game for software engineering.  As an industry, we are quick to adopt practices that increase flexibility of development and velocity of deployment.  An urgent question follows on the heels of these benefits: How much confidence we can have in the complex systems that we put into production?
>Even when all of the individual services in a distributed system are functioning properly, the interactions between those services can cause unpredictable outcomes.  Unpredictable outcomes, compounded by rare but disruptive real-world events that affect production environments, make these distributed systems inherently chaotic.
>We need to identify weaknesses before they manifest in system-wide, aberrant behaviors.  Systemic weaknesses could take the form of: improper fallback settings when a service is unavailable; retry storms from improperly tuned timeouts; outages when a downstream dependency receives too much traffic; cascading failures when a single point of failure crashes; etc.  We must address the most significant weaknesses proactively, before they affect our customers in production.  We need a way to manage the chaos inherent in these systems, take advantage of increasing flexibility and velocity, and have confidence in our production deployments despite the complexity that they represent.
>An empirical, systems-based approach addresses the chaos in distributed systems at scale and builds confidence in the ability of those systems to withstand realistic conditions.  We learn about the behavior of a distributed system by observing it during a controlled experiment.  We call this Chaos Engineering.

## 3.2
>Agile software development values
Based on their combined experience of developing software and helping others do that, the seventeen signatories to the manifesto proclaimed that they value:

>Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools
Working Software over comprehensive documentation
Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to Change over following a plan
That is to say, the items on the left are valued more than the items on the right.

## 3.4
> Agile represents an overarching philosophy for software development, emphasizing the value of iterating quickly and often to satisfy customers. An agile framework can be defined as a specific software-development approach based on the agile philosophy articulated in the Agile Manifesto.
